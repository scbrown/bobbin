Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption. Do NOT guess what a step requires\nbased on the step title or your role knowledge.

Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order.

Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption. Do NOT guess what a step requires\nbased on the step title or your role knowledge. The step description is the\nsource of truth.\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| wisp_type | patrol | Type of wisp created for this molecule |\n| integration_branch_refinery_enabled | true | Whether refinery merges to integration branches |\n| integration_branch_auto_land | false | Whether to auto-land integration branches when epic children all closed |\n| run_tests | true | Whether to run tests before merging |\n| setup_command | (empty) | Setup/install command (e.g., `pnpm install`). Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order.

CRITICAL: Notifications come IMMEDIATELY after push.\n\n**Config: integration_branch_refinery_enabled = true**\n**Config: target_branch = main**\n**Config: delete_merged_branches = true**\n\nWhen integration_branch_refinery_enabled = \"true\", the MR's target branch\nmay be an integration branch (not just main). Check the MR's target field and use\nthat as the merge destination. Only fall back to main if no explicit target is set.\n\n**Step 1: Merge and Push**\nDetermine the merge target: use the MR's target field if set, otherwise main.\n```bash\ngit checkout \u003cmerge-target\u003e\ngit merge --ff-only temp\ngit push origin \u003cmerge-target\u003e\n```\n\n**Step 1.5: VERIFY PUSH SUCCEEDED (CRITICAL - PATCH-003)**\n\nPush can fail silently (network, auth, hooks). IMMEDIATELY verify:\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\nLOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse \u003cmerge-target\u003e)\nREMOTE_SHA=$(git rev-parse origin/\u003cmerge-target\u003e)\necho \"Local:  $LOCAL_SHA\"\necho \"Remote: $REMOTE_SHA\"\n```\n\n**If SHAs match**: Push succeeded. Continue to Step 2.\n\n**If SHAs differ**: STOP. Push failed silently.\n- DO NOT send MERGED notification\n- DO NOT close MR bead\n- DO NOT delete branch\n- Debug the push failure (check `git push` output, network, auth)\n- Retry push and verify again before proceeding\n\n⚠️ **STOP HERE - DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL STEPS 1.5 AND 2-3 COMPLETE**\n\n**Step 2: Send MERGED Notification (REQUIRED - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)**\n\nRIGHT NOW, before any cleanup, send MERGED mail to Witness:\n\n```bash\ngt mail send \u003crig\u003e/witness -s \"MERGED \u003cpolecat-name\u003e\" -m \"Branch: \u003cbranch\u003e\nIssue: \u003cissue-id\u003e\nMerged-At: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"\n```\n\nThis signals the Witness to nuke the polecat worktree. WITHOUT THIS NOTIFICATION,\nPOLECAT WORKTREES ACCUMULATE INDEFINITELY AND THE LIFECYCLE BREAKS.\n\n**Step 3: Close MR Bead (REQUIRED - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)**\n\n⚠️ **VERIFICATION BEFORE CLOSING**: Confirm the work is actually on the merge target:\n```bash\n# Get the commit message/issue from the branch\ngit log origin/\u003cmerge-target\u003e --oneline | grep \"\u003cissue-id\u003e\"\n# OR verify the commit SHA is on the target:\ngit branch --contains \u003ccommit-sha\u003e | grep \u003cmerge-target\u003e\n```\n\nIf work is NOT on the merge target, DO NOT close the MR bead. Investigate first.\n\n```bash\nbd close \u003cmr-bead-id\u003e --reason \"Merged to \u003cmerge-target\u003e at $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)\"\n```\n\nThe MR bead ID was in the MERGE_READY message or find via:\n```bash\nbd list --type=merge-request --status=open | grep \u003cpolecat-name\u003e\n```\n\n**VALIDATION**: The MR bead's source_issue should be a valid bead ID (gt-xxxxx),\nnot a branch name. If source_issue contains a branch name, flag for investigation.\n\n**Step 4: Archive the MERGE_READY mail (REQUIRED)**\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmerge-ready-message-id\u003e\n```\nThe message ID was tracked when you processed inbox-check.\n\n**Step 5: Cleanup (only after Steps 2-4 confirmed)**\n```bash\ngit branch -d temp\n```\n\ndelete_merged_branches (see config above) controls whether to delete the remote source branch.\n\nIf delete_merged_branches is \"true\":\n```bash\ngit push origin --delete \u003cpolecat-branch\u003e\n```\n\nIf delete_merged_branches is \"false\": Leave the remote branch intact.\n\n**VERIFICATION GATE**: You CANNOT proceed to loop-check without:\n- [x] MERGED mail sent to witness\n- [x] MR bead closed\n- [x] MERGE_READY mail archived\n\nIf you skipped notifications or archiving, GO BACK AND DO THEM NOW.\n\nTarget branch has moved. Any remaining branches need rebasing on new baseline.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":1,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"BOB-wisp-x4ky","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Merge and push","updated_at":"2026-02-27T19:02:09Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
