Specific issues:\n\n1. **Prompt::new signature**: Takes 3 args (name, description, arguments) but the types don't match documentation\n2. **PromptMessage types**: Uses `PromptMessageRole` not `Role`, and `PromptMessageContent` not `Content`\n3. **Annotated struct**: Constructor pattern unclear - `Annotated::new(raw, annotations)` vs `Annotated::raw()`\n\n## How to Fix\n1. Check the actual rmcp 0.8.5 source code for correct type signatures\n2. Or upgrade to a newer rmcp version (0.12.0 available) which may have clearer API\n3. Update `src/mcp/server.rs` to use correct types for:\n   - `list_prompts` return type\n   - `get_prompt` return type (PromptMessage construction)\n   - Possibly simplify by removing prompts/resources if tools work first\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `src/mcp/server.rs` (lines 708-765 primarily)\n- Possibly `Cargo.toml` if upgrading rmcp version\n\n## Testing\nAfter fixes, run:\n```bash\ncargo check\ncargo build\n# Then test with MCP Inspector or Claude Code\n```","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"stiwi","created_at":"2026-01-06T03:27:43Z","created_by":"stiwi","updated_at":"2026-01-06T03:46:04Z","closed_at":"2026-01-06T03:46:04Z","work_type":"mutex"}
