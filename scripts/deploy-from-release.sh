# deploy-from-release.sh — PULL-based deploy: fetch a published GitHub release
# artifact, verify it, and hand it to deploy-cutover.sh (aegis-56a).
#
# WHY PULL AND NOT A BUILD RUNNER. This bead was originally scoped as "stand up a
# self-hosted GitHub Actions runner". That design was retired on 2026-08-03: a pull
# needs no inbound path, no runner registration, and no build toolchain on the
# serving host (which is a thermally marginal low-TDP mobile CPU that throttles
# under sustained load). The
# release artifacts are already built by CI on four targets; re-building them on the
# serving host buys nothing and costs a runner nobody maintains.
#
# WHY THE TARBALL AND NOT `bobbin-linux-amd64`. The release publishes BOTH raw
# binaries and per-target tarballs, but **SHA256SUMS.txt covers ONLY the tarballs**
# (measured on v0.6.6: 4 checksum lines, all `*.tar.gz`, none for the two raw
# binaries). A pull-based deploy that fetched the raw binary would have nothing to
# verify it against — the one property that makes pulling safe. So this fetches the
# checksummed artifact. If the raw binaries are ever added to SHA256SUMS.txt this can
# change; until then, fetching them is unverifiable by construction.
#
# THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY, end to end:
#   1. download <tarball> + SHA256SUMS.txt from the named release
#   2. VERIFY the tarball against SHA256SUMS.txt   -> refuse on mismatch
#   3. extract, and check the binary reports the version we asked for
#   4. FEATURE PRE-FLIGHT: the same featureless-sentinel probe deploy-cutover.sh
#      uses, run HERE so a bad artifact is caught before anything reaches the host
#   5. hand to deploy-cutover.sh, which owns the dangerous half: stage (never over
#      live), `--version` ABI gate ON THE HOST, feature gate, snapshot -> PREV,
#      atomic swap, restart, smoke, and ROLLBACK on any smoke failure
#
# Step 4 duplicates a check deploy-cutover.sh already makes, deliberately: the same
# probe is cheap, and catching a featureless artifact locally means never having
# staged it on the serving host at all. The gate downstream stays authoritative.
#
# Usage:  deploy-from-release.sh [<tag>]          (default: latest release)
# Env:    DEPLOY_HOST (required, passed through), DRY_RUN=1 to stop after step 4,
#         TARGET (default x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu), REQUIRE_KNOWLEDGE (see cutover).
