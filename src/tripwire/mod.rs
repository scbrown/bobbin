//! Governed tripwires, surfaced in injected context.
//!
//! A **tripwire** is the governance plane's `Binding / Gate` primitive at its
//! simplest: an `aegis:Policy` at `aegis:boundary "action"` carrying
//! `aegis:appliesTo` path globs and **no** selector or predicate — touching the
//! path *is* the crossing, so the claim needs no evidence beyond the action's
//! own target. Quipu is the canonical store
//! (`shapes/policies/tripwire.ttl`, `docs/book/src/concepts/governance.md`);
//! yupana projects them and enforces the ones it can at its pre-edit guard
//! (`src/project_tripwire.rs`).
//!
//! Bobbin's job is neither of those. Bobbin **tells the agent a wire is there
//! before it walks into one** — the boundary shows up in the same injected
//! bundle as the code it spans, so "I did not know that path was governed" is
//! not available as an excuse or as a surprise.
//!
//! ## Three lines this module will not cross
//!
//! 1. **Bobbin does not enforce.** Every rendered line says what the policy
//!    *declares*, never what bobbin will do. Bobbin has no pre-edit hook and
//!    cannot block a write; a section implying otherwise would be the
//!    armed-looking-inert-control defect the whole tripwire concept exists to
//!    prevent, inverted.
//! 2. **Bobbin never drops a wire it does not understand.** Yupana refuses a
//!    projection carrying an effect it cannot enforce, and it is right to: a
//!    dropped wire there is a boundary that reads as guarded and is not. Here
//!    the failure runs the other way — a dropped wire is a boundary the agent
//!    is never told about. So an unrecognised effect is *surfaced verbatim*
//!    ([`TripEffect::Other`]) and an absent one is surfaced as undeclared. The
//!    full `aegis:effect` vocabulary is `allow | warn | require-approval |
//!    deny | escalate | record` plus the catalog's `throttle`; bobbin reads all
//!    of it because it only has to *name* an effect, not execute it.
//! 3. **Nothing is presented as current that is not.** Every section states
//!    where the facts came from and how old they are. A cached projection says
//!    it is cached and how stale; a failed refresh says the refresh failed
//!    rather than quietly serving yesterday's boundaries as today's.
//!
//! ## Why both injection paths read this directly
//!
//! Bobbin injects context two ways: locally (`bobbin inject-context`, which
//! opens the stores itself) and as a thin client (`--server`, which asks a
//! bobbin server for `/context`). The obvious design puts the tripwires on the
//! `/context` response so the thin client stays thin. This module does not do
//! that, for two reasons:
//!
//! - **The two paths must not disagree.** Routing governance through the
//!   server makes "which boundaries am I told about" depend on which bobbin
//!   deployment answered, which is exactly the divergence that got the sibling
//!   bead (`bobbin-dee`) deferred. Reading the graph from the same place in
//!   both paths makes them identical by construction rather than by review.
//! - **A search server should not be able to suppress a governance boundary.**
//!   The quipu endpoint is an organisation fact, not a bobbin-deployment
//!   detail. Keeping bobbin's own server out of the path means a
//!   misconfigured or compromised index host cannot silently un-govern a repo.
//!
//! The cost is that a thin client needs to reach quipu itself. It already
//! loads local bobbin config for every other hook setting, so this adds a
//! reachability requirement, not a configuration one.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! None of its own, deliberately. The transport is the existing
//! `quipu_endpoint` key — the same one search spotlight annotations and the
//! MCP ontology tools use — with `BOBBIN_QUIPU_REMOTE` overriding it, matching
//! `src/mcp/server.rs`. A second knob meaning "where is quipu" would let one
//! surface work while another silently did not. **No endpoint configured means
//! no governance plane**: the section is absent and no HTTP call is made, so
//! an ungoverned deployment pays nothing on the hook's hot path.
