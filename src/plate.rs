//! plate — the agent's current work item, published by the harness.
//!
//! Bobbin's context injection is per-prompt and stateless: it sees the prompt
//! text and nothing about what the agent is actually assigned to. yupana's
//! `docs/work-scoped-governance.md` §3 names both the gap and the cost — agents
//! rediscover the same context repeatedly, because retrieval starts from zero
//! every prompt. Keyed on the work item, retrieval becomes cumulative: the
//! second session on an item starts where the first finished.
//!
//! WE READ A FILE; WE DO NOT ASK ANYONE. The tracker owns `(agent → work item)`
//! and has more than one backend behind one interface, so resolving it here
//! would create a SECOND implementation that can disagree with the first.
//! Shelling out to the tracker's CLI is equally rejected: this runs on the
//! prompt-submit path, once per prompt, and a subprocess against a
//! network-backed tracker is not affordable there. So shantytown PUBLISHES
//! (`shantytown/shantytown/plate_publish.py`) and consumers READ:
//!
//! ```text
//! $SHANTY_ROOT/crew/$SHANTY_AGENT/plate.json
//! {"item": "abc-123", "at": <unix secs>, "session": "<id>|null"}
//! ```
//!
//! yupana reads the same file (`yupana/src/plate.rs`). That is the point of the
//! file existing rather than being a call: two tools, one published answer, no
//! second implementation. Bobbin deliberately does NOT ask yupana — the two own
//! different halves of an agent's context (bobbin: semantic code; yupana:
//! governance and work item) and nesting one tool's injection inside the
//! other's would inject the same context twice.
//!
//! ABSTAIN, NEVER GUESS. Missing, unreadable, malformed, empty or stale all
//! return `None`, and `None` means UNKNOWN — not "no work". A wrong work item
//! would silently bias every retrieval for a session toward the wrong subject,
//! which is worse than the stateless behaviour it replaces because it looks
//! like it is working.
