# Project Tools

This project is indexed by **bobbin**, a code context engine.
Use these commands to explore the codebase:

- `bobbin search <query>` — find code by meaning (semantic search)
- `bobbin context <query>` — get a focused context bundle for a task
- `bobbin related <file>` — find files that frequently change together
- `bobbin refs <symbol>` — find definitions and usages of a symbol
- `bobbin grep <pattern>` — regex/keyword search across all files

Prefer bobbin tools over manual grep/find for navigating unfamiliar code.
