Quarantined eval tasks — excluded from active runs.

flask-001 through flask-005: 0% test pass rate on BOTH with-bobbin and
no-bobbin approaches (47 runs, Feb 10-11 2026). Root cause appears to be
setup_command or test_command issues, not bobbin. Re-enable after fixing
the flask task definitions.

Moved here 2026-02-15 as part of aegis-rdpt investigation.
