description: |
  Fix config include paths to explicitly reject glob patterns and template
  braces. Currently, include paths containing glob characters like
  `config-*.toml` or template braces like `{workspace-root}/config.toml`
  are silently accepted but never expanded, causing confusing "file not found"
  errors. Add validation in `_load_includes()` that detects glob characters
  (`*`, `?`, `[`) and template braces (`{`, `}`) and returns clear,
  descriptive error messages explaining that these syntaxes are not supported.
