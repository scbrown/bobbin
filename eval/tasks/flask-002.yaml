description: |
  Refactor the CLI module to inline conditional imports (dotenv, ssl,
  importlib.metadata) at their point of use instead of importing them at
  module level. This avoids import errors and unnecessary imports when the
  optional dependencies are not installed, and moves version-conditional
  importlib.metadata handling into the method that actually uses it.
