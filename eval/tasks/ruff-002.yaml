description: |
  Add `multiprocessing.Value` to the list of functions excluded from the
  flake8-boolean-trap rule FBT003. The `Value` constructor commonly takes a
  boolean as its second argument (e.g., `Value("b", False)`), and this is a
  legitimate use case that should not trigger a boolean positional argument
  warning. Implement a new `is_semantically_allowed_func_call` helper that
  uses qualified name resolution to match the call, and integrate it into the
  existing `allow_boolean_trap` logic.
