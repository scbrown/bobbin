  Fix panic in runtime/metrics.Read when called with a nil or empty slice.
  The function unconditionally accesses &m[0] to pass a pointer to the
  runtime, which causes an "index out of range" panic when the slice is
  empty. Add a guard checking len(m) == 0 to return early before accessing
  the first element. The fix is a 3-line addition in sample.go.
test_command: "cd src && go test runtime/metrics -run TestReadEmptySlice -count=1"
