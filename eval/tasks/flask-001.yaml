description: |
  Fix the Vary: Cookie header to be set consistently when the session is
  accessed, modified, or refreshed. Previously, the header was only set when
  the session was modified but not when it was merely accessed or when a
  session cookie was being deleted. Move the Vary header logic so it covers
  all code paths in save_session, including cookie deletion and session
  refresh without modification.
