You are an expert code reviewer comparing two solutions to the same coding task.

## Task Context

**Repository:** {{ repo }}
**Task description:** {{ description }}
**Language:** {{ language }}

## Solution A

```diff
{{ diff_a }}
```

## Solution B

```diff
{{ diff_b }}
```

## Evaluation Criteria

Score each solution on these dimensions (1-5 scale):

1. **Consistency**: Does the code follow existing codebase patterns and conventions?
2. **Completeness**: Are edge cases handled? Is the fix thorough?
3. **Minimality**: Is the diff surgical and focused, or does it include unnecessary changes?

## Instructions

- Compare the two solutions directly against each other
- Consider only the quality of the code changes, not which was produced by whom
- If solutions are equivalent in quality, declare a tie
- Provide brief reasoning for each dimension before giving scores

## Output Format

Respond in this exact JSON format:

```json
{
  "dimensions": {
    "consistency": {"a": <score>, "b": <score>, "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"},
    "completeness": {"a": <score>, "b": <score>, "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"},
    "minimality": {"a": <score>, "b": <score>, "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"}
  },
  "overall_winner": "<a|b|tie>",
  "reasoning": "<one sentence summary>"
}
```
