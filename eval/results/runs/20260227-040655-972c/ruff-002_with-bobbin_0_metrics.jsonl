The `Value` constructor commonly takes a\nboolean as its second argument (e.g., `Value(\"b\", False)`), and this is a\nlegitimate use case that should not trigger a boolean positional argument\nwarning. Implement a new `is_semantically_allowed_func_call` helper that\nuses qualified name resolution to match the call, and integrate it into the\nexisting `allow_boolean_trap` logic.\n\nImplement the fix. Run the test suite with `cargo test -p ruff_linter -- flake8_boolean_trap` to verify.\n\nThis project has bobbin installed (a semantic code search engine). Before exploring manually, use bobbin to find relevant code:\n- `bobbin search \"<key terms from the task>\"` — semantic + keyword search\n- `bobbin related <file>` — find test files and co-changing dependencies\n- `bobbin refs <SymbolName>` — trace definitions and usages\nStart with bobbin search to orient yourself, then read the files it identifies.","source_files":7,"top_score":0.605484127998352}}
