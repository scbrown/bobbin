Without\nparentheses, a starred element in an except clause is parsed as `except*`\n(exception group syntax) rather than a tuple containing a starred element,\nchanging semantics. Add a check for starred expressions in the tuple before\nremoving parentheses.\n\nImplement the fix. Run the test suite with `cargo test -p ruff_python_formatter -- except_handler` to verify.\n\nThis project has bobbin installed (a semantic code search engine). Before exploring manually, use bobbin to find relevant code:\n- `bobbin search \"<key terms from the task>\"` — semantic + keyword search\n- `bobbin related <file>` — find test files and co-changing dependencies\n- `bobbin refs <SymbolName>` — trace definitions and usages\nStart with bobbin search to orient yourself, then read the files it identifies.","source_files":12,"top_score":0.6088343858718872}}
