Fix by wrapping the\noutput-writing match block in a `log_level > LogLevel::Silent` guard so\nthat no stdout output is produced in silent mode. Add integration tests\nfor both `--silent` and `--quiet` modes to verify correct output behavior.\n\nImplement the fix. Run the test suite with `cargo test -p ruff -- format` to verify.\n\nThis project has bobbin installed (a semantic code search engine). Before exploring manually, use bobbin to find relevant code:\n- `bobbin search \"<key terms from the task>\"` — semantic + keyword search\n- `bobbin related <file>` — find test files and co-changing dependencies\n- `bobbin refs <SymbolName>` — trace definitions and usages\nStart with bobbin search to orient yourself, then read the files it identifies.","source_files":7,"top_score":0.6134874820709229}}
