(2) Improve diagnostic ranges to point\nat the exact private name segment rather than the entire import binding,\nusing a tokenizer to locate the private segment in module paths and alias\nname ranges for imported members.\n\nImplement the fix. Run the test suite with `cargo test -p ruff_linter -- PLC2701` to verify.\n\nThis project has bobbin installed (a semantic code search engine). Before exploring manually, use bobbin to find relevant code:\n- `bobbin search \"<key terms from the task>\"` — semantic + keyword search\n- `bobbin related <file>` — find test files and co-changing dependencies\n- `bobbin refs <SymbolName>` — trace definitions and usages\nStart with bobbin search to orient yourself, then read the files it identifies.","source_files":1,"top_score":0.6134727001190186}}
