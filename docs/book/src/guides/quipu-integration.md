# Quipu Integration

Bobbin optionally integrates with [Quipu](https://github.com/scbrown/quipu), a knowledge graph that stores structured facts as an EAVT (Entity-Attribute-Value-Time) log. When enabled, Bobbin's MCP server exposes Quipu's tools alongside its own, giving AI agents access to both code search and structured knowledge in a single session.

## Enabling the Integration

Quipu is gated behind the `knowledge` Cargo feature:

```bash
cargo build --features knowledge
```

This pulls in Quipu as a git dependency. Without the feature flag, Bobbin compiles and runs normally with no Quipu code included.

## Configuration

When the `knowledge` feature is enabled, add a `[knowledge]` section to `.bobbin/config.toml`:

```toml
[knowledge]
enabled = true
store_path = ".bobbin/knowledge.db"
schema_path = "schemas/"          # SHACL shapes for validation
auto_embed = true                 # embed entities using Bobbin's ONNX pipeline
```

## MCP Tools

With Quipu enabled, `bobbin serve` exposes these additional MCP tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `knowledge_context` | Semantic search over knowledge graph entities, across the remote ontology and the local code graph. |
| `knowledge_query` | Run SPARQL SELECT queries against both graphs, with optional temporal filtering. |
| `knowledge_export` | Export a canonical scoped RDF slice from the remote Quipu, optionally digest-only. |
| `knowledge_share` | Produce Quipu's canonical v1 manifest and exact share files. |
| `knowledge_import` | Verify and stage a canonical share; never promotes it. |
| `knowledge_import_promote` | Explicitly promote an eligible staged share into ROOT. |
| `knowledge_knot` | Write facts into the local embedded graph as RDF Turtle, with SHACL validation when compiled in. |
| `knowledge_reconcile_mentions` | Resolve chunk mention literals into typed edges against the live entity graph. |
| `knowledge_inferred_extract` | Run the quarantined-track extractor over markdown prose (see below). |

These appear alongside Bobbin's existing tools (search, grep, context, etc.) in a single MCP server. See the [Tools Reference](../mcp/tools.md) for parameters and response shapes.

### Example: knowledge_context

Ask for knowledge entities related to a topic:

```json
{
  "tool": "knowledge_context",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "authentication flow",
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

### Example: knowledge_query

Run a SPARQL query against the graph:

```json
{
  "tool": "knowledge_query",
  "arguments": {
    "sparql": "SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10"
  }
}
```

## Publishing Chunk Snapshots

With `quipu_push_chunks = true` (a top-level key in `.bobbin/config.toml`), every index run publishes the repository's governed code-entity graph as a **diffed snapshot replacement** under the producer key `bobbin-chunks:{repo}` — so a reindex diffs against the previous run rather than accumulating a copy per run. The snapshot carries `CodeModule`, `CodeSymbol`, `Document`, and `Section` facts plus chunk identity, membership, order, and adjacency — never chunk content.

Where the snapshot goes depends on `quipu_endpoint`:

- **Set** — the snapshot is delivered to that remote Quipu's authenticated `/knot` endpoint. The bearer token is resolved from `QUIPU_AUTH_TOKEN`, then `QUIPU_AUTH_TOKEN_FILE`, then `~/.config/aegis/quipu_token`; with no token available the push fails rather than sending unauthenticated.
- **Unset** — the snapshot lands in the embedded local store.

Either way the target must support snapshot replacement: Bobbin probes for it first and refuses (with a message) rather than letting facts accumulate per run. After a successful push, `bobbin index` also runs the mention-reconcile pass over the local graph — the same pass the `knowledge_reconcile_mentions` tool runs on demand.

Chunk publication is part of a successful index run, not best-effort telemetry. If the single
bounded `/knot` attempt fails, the command reports `dropped_pushes=1` and exits nonzero; it does
not retry an abandoned request or let a scheduler record an incomplete graph as success. Remote
requests carry `X-Quipu-Client: ingest-cron` for server-side attribution.

## Quarantined Inferred Extraction

Facts that are *inferred* from prose are claims, not observations, and Bobbin keeps that distinction structural. The inferred track is a pluggable extractor seam; the one extractor today is a deterministic backtick-coderef heuristic over markdown — not a language model, and every fact it produces says so.

Candidates never mix with observed facts:

- Each fact carries its extractor and parameters as the derivation method, and `sourceKind = inferred`.
- Facts land only in a dedicated quarantined plane at trust rank 0, via a graph-routed `/knot` write. The push refuses when the store cannot enforce graph routing — inferred facts must never masquerade in the default graph at observed standing.
- The `knowledge_inferred_extract` MCP tool serves candidates only inside the quarantine envelope (plane, trust rank, source kind), never bare.
- Promotion out of quarantine is the governing ontology's authority-gated flow, deliberately not implemented in Bobbin.

Set `quipu_push_inferred = true` (top-level key, opt-in) to run the extractor over markdown prose during indexing and land the stamped candidates in the quarantined plane as a diffed snapshot. It requires the `knowledge` feature, a Quipu revision with strict `/knot` graph routing, and the quarantine plane registered and trust-labelled on the store.

```

Key design decisions:

- **Feature-gated**: Quipu is optional (`--features knowledge`). Bobbin works without it.
- **Async bridge**: Quipu is synchronous; Bobbin is async. Calls bridge via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking()`.
- **Shared embeddings**: Both systems use the same ONNX model session for vector generation.
- **Single MCP server**: One `bobbin serve` process exposes both Bobbin and Quipu tools.

## Share bundle contract

Bobbin's knowledge build includes typed consumer models for Quipu's versioned
share manifest and import request/response. A canonical v1 share contains
`manifest.json`, `export.nt`, and `shapes.ttl`; `export.ttl` is an optional
human-readable view and is not the graph identity. Consumers reject unsupported
manifest versions and non-canonical paths. Additive fields within v1 are
preserved during typed round trips so an older Bobbin does not erase extensions
from a newer compatible Quipu.

The checked-in fixture at `tests/fixtures/quipu-share-v1/` exercises graph and
shape hashes, the JCS-derived share identity, sorted duplicate-free N-Triples,
staged import resolution, quarantine, and promotion blockers. It is the contract
fixture for future `knowledge_*` adapters. Those adapters delegate canonical
serialization, identity resolution, quarantine, and RDF merge semantics to
Quipu; Bobbin does not define a parallel bundle format. `knowledge_share`
returns the producer's manifest and files unchanged. `knowledge_import` preserves
the producer's resolution, validation, quarantine, and promotion state, while
`knowledge_import_promote` keeps admission as a separate deliberate operation.

## Integration Roadmap

The integration is being built in phases. See [docs/plans/quipu-integration.md](https://github.com/scbrown/bobbin/blob/main/docs/plans/quipu-integration.md) for the full plan.

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Crate dependency | Done | Quipu as git dep, feature-gated behind `knowledge` |
| 2. Shared embedding pipeline | Planned | Shared ONNX session via `EmbeddingProvider` trait |
| 3. MCP tool surface | Done | `knowledge_context` and `knowledge_query` tools wired in |
| 4. Unified search results | Planned | Merge code + knowledge results with normalized scores |
| 5. Knowledge-aware context | Planned | Context assembly expanded with knowledge graph facts |

## Governed Path Boundaries

Setting `quipu_endpoint` also turns on tripwire surfacing: governed path-boundary
policies spanning the files Bobbin is about to inject are named in the injected
context, so an agent sees a boundary before it crosses one. Unlike the MCP tools
above this needs no `knowledge` feature — it reads Quipu's `POST /query` over
HTTP. See [Governed Path Boundaries](governed-boundaries.md).
