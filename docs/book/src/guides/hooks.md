# Hooks

Bobbin's hook system integrates with Claude Code to automatically inject relevant code context into every conversation. When you type a prompt, bobbin searches your index for code related to what you're asking about and injects it before Claude sees the message. The result: Claude understands your codebase without you having to copy-paste code.

## How hooks work

Bobbin installs two Claude Code hooks:

1. **UserPromptSubmit** — fires on every prompt you send. Bobbin runs a semantic search against your query, and if the results are relevant enough, injects them as context that Claude can see.
2. **SessionStart (compact)** — fires after Claude Code compacts its context window. Bobbin re-injects key context so Claude doesn't lose codebase awareness after compaction.

Both hooks are non-blocking and add minimal latency to your interaction.

## Setting up hooks

### Prerequisites

You need a bobbin index first:

```bash
bobbin init
bobbin index
```

### Install hooks

```bash
bobbin hook install
```

This adds hook entries to your project's `.claude/settings.json`. From now on, every prompt in this project directory triggers automatic context injection.

For global installation (all projects):

```bash
bobbin hook install --global
```

Global hooks write to `~/.claude/settings.json` and fire in every Claude Code session, regardless of project.

### Verify installation

```bash
bobbin hook status
```

Output shows whether hooks are installed and the current configuration:

```text
Claude Code hooks: installed
Git hook: not installed

Configuration:
  threshold:        0.5
  budget:           150 lines
  content_mode:     preview
  min_prompt_length: 10
  gate_threshold:   0.75
  dedup:            enabled
```

## Tuning injection behavior

The defaults work for most projects, but you can tune how aggressively bobbin injects context.

### Threshold

The **threshold** controls the minimum relevance score for a search result to be included in the injected context:

```bash
bobbin hook install --threshold 0.3    # More results, lower relevance bar
bobbin hook install --threshold 0.7    # Fewer results, higher quality
```

Lower values mean more code gets injected (broader context). Higher values mean only highly relevant code is injected (tighter focus).

You can also set this in `.bobbin/config.toml`:

```toml
[hooks]
threshold = 0.5
```

### Budget

The **budget** limits the total lines of injected context:

```bash
bobbin hook install --budget 200    # More context
bobbin hook install --budget 50     # Minimal context
```

A larger budget gives Claude more code to work with. A smaller budget keeps injections concise and avoids overwhelming the context window.

```toml
[hooks]
budget = 150
```

### Gate threshold

The **gate threshold** is a separate check that decides whether injection happens *at all*. Before injecting, bobbin checks the top semantic search result's raw similarity score. If it falls below the gate threshold, the entire injection is skipped — your prompt isn't relevant to the indexed code.

```toml
[hooks]
gate_threshold = 0.75    # Default: skip injection if top result < 0.75 similarity
```

Lower values make injection more eager (fires on loosely related prompts). Higher values make it more conservative (only fires when the prompt clearly relates to indexed code).

### Minimum prompt length

Very short prompts ("yes", "ok", "continue") don't benefit from code injection. The `min_prompt_length` setting skips injection for prompts below a character threshold:

```toml
[hooks]
min_prompt_length = 10    # Default
```

### Content mode

Controls how much code is included per result:

```toml
[hooks]
content_mode = "preview"    # 3-line excerpts (default)
# content_mode = "full"     # Full source code
# content_mode = "none"     # Paths and metadata only
```

**`preview`** is the default and works well for most cases — it gives Claude enough to understand each result without consuming too much of the context window.

**`full`** is useful when you want Claude to have complete function implementations in context, not just previews.

### Deduplication

By default, bobbin tracks what it injected in the previous prompt and skips re-injection if the results haven't changed. This avoids flooding Claude's context with the same code on follow-up messages about the same topic.

```toml
[hooks]
dedup_enabled = true    # Default
```

Set to `false` if you want every prompt to get fresh injection regardless.

## Full configuration reference

All settings in `.bobbin/config.toml` under `[hooks]`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `threshold` | `0.5` | Minimum relevance score to include a result |
| `budget` | `150` | Maximum lines of injected context |
| `content_mode` | `"preview"` | Display mode: `full`, `preview`, or `none` |
| `min_prompt_length` | `10` | Skip injection for prompts shorter than this |
| `gate_threshold` | `0.75` | Minimum top-result similarity to inject at all |
| `dedup_enabled` | `true` | Skip injection when results match previous session |

## Git hooks

Separately from Claude Code hooks, bobbin can install a git post-commit hook to keep the index fresh:

```bash
bobbin hook install-git-hook
```

This re-indexes files changed in each commit. See [Watch & Automation](watch-automation.md) for details on keeping your index current.

## Hot topics

After using hooks for a while, bobbin accumulates data on which code areas are most frequently injected. The `hot-topics` subcommand generates a summary:

```bash
bobbin hook hot-topics
```

This writes `hot-topics.md` with analytics about your most-referenced code. Use it to identify which parts of your codebase come up most often in AI conversations — these are the areas worth keeping well-documented and well-structured.

Use `--force` to regenerate even if the injection count hasn't reached the automatic threshold:

```bash
bobbin hook hot-topics --force
```

## Removing hooks

Remove Claude Code hooks:

```bash
bobbin hook uninstall

# Or for global hooks:
bobbin hook uninstall --global
```

Remove the git post-commit hook:

```bash
bobbin hook uninstall-git-hook
```

## Practical workflows

### Daily development setup

Install hooks once per project, then forget about them:

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
bobbin init && bobbin index
bobbin hook install
bobbin hook install-git-hook    # Keep index fresh on commits
```

Now every Claude Code conversation in this directory automatically gets relevant code context.

### Combining hooks with watch mode

For real-time index updates (not just on commits):

```bash
bobbin hook install         # Context injection
bobbin watch &              # Real-time index updates
```

This ensures the injected context reflects your latest uncommitted changes, not just what was last committed.

### Debugging injection

If Claude doesn't seem to be getting the right context, check what bobbin would inject for a given prompt:

```bash
echo '{"query": "how does auth work"}' | bobbin hook inject-context --no-dedup
```

Or check the hook status to verify configuration:

```bash
bobbin hook status --json
```
