# Configuration

Bobbin stores its configuration in `.bobbin/config.toml`, created by `bobbin init`.

## Full Default Configuration

```toml
# Quipu knowledge-graph endpoint (e.g. "http://quipu.example"). When set, search
# results are annotated with entity spotlight data. Unset by default.
# Top-level key — must appear before the first [section] header.
# quipu_endpoint = "http://quipu.example"

[server]
# All three keys are unset by default (thin-client / serve options).

# Remote bobbin HTTP server URL for thin-client mode. When set, this machine
# queries the remote server instead of using a local index.
# url = "http://search.example"

# Bind address for `bobbin serve --http`. Runtime fallback when unset: "0.0.0.0".

## Section Reference

### `[index]`

Controls which files are indexed.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `include` | string[] | See above | Glob patterns for files to include |
| `exclude` | string[] | See above | Additional exclusion patterns (on top of `.gitignore`) |
| `use_gitignore` | bool | `true` | Whether to respect `.gitignore` files |
| `chunk_size` | int | `50` | Lines per chunk for the line-based (unknown-language) chunker. |
| `chunk_overlap` | int | `10` | Overlapping lines between consecutive line-based chunks. Capped below `chunk_size`. |

Line-based chunks are additionally clamped to the embedding model's token window (`max_seq`) so a dense chunk never silently overflows and gets truncated at embed time — chunks are split to fit. The default model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) has a 256-token window; `bge-small-en-v1.5` and `gte-small` allow 512.

### `[embedding]`

Controls embedding model and batch processing.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | string | `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` | ONNX embedding model name. Downloaded to `~/.cache/bobbin/models/` on first use. |
| `batch_size` | int | `32` | Number of chunks to embed per batch |

### `[embedding.context]`

Controls contextual embedding, where chunks are embedded with surrounding source lines for better retrieval.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `context_lines` | int | `5` | Lines of context before and after each chunk |
| `enabled_languages` | string[] | `["markdown"]` | Languages where contextual embedding is active |

### `[search]`

Controls search behavior defaults.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `default_limit` | int | `10` | Default number of results returned |
| `semantic_weight` | float | `0.9` | Balance between semantic (1.0) and keyword (0.0) in hybrid mode |

### `[hooks]`

Controls Claude Code hook behavior for automatic context injection.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `threshold` | float | `0.5` | Per-result filter on normalized RRF scores |
| `budget` | int | `300` | Maximum lines of injected context |
| `content_mode` | string | `"full"` | Content display mode: `full`, `preview`, or `none` |
| `min_prompt_length` | int | `20` | Skip injection for prompts shorter than this |
| `gate_threshold` | float | `0.45` | Minimum raw semantic similarity (cosine, before RRF) to inject at all. If the top result's score is below this, the entire injection is skipped. |
| `dedup_enabled` | bool | `true` | Skip injection when search results match the previous prompt's session ID (same top-10 chunks = same session) |

### `[git]`

Controls temporal coupling analysis from git history.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `coupling_enabled` | bool | `true` | Enable temporal coupling analysis |
| `coupling_depth` | int | `5000` | How many commits back to analyze |
| `coupling_threshold` | int | `3` | Minimum co-changes to establish a coupling relationship |

### `[context]`

Tunes context assembly — the bridging + knowledge-expansion pipeline that is Bobbin's core differentiator. These knobs were previously hardcoded (and inconsistent) at each call site; surfacing them here lets you tune behavior without recompiling. Defaults match the tuned production values used by the hook and HTTP injection paths. CLI/HTTP request parameters still override these per-call.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `bridge_boost_factor` | float | `0.3` | Score multiplier for bridge-boosted files: `final_score *= (1.0 + factor)`. Only used in `boost`/`boost_inject` bridge modes. |
| `max_bridged_files` | int | `2` | Max bridged files to fetch chunks for. Prevents bridge explosion from doc→source blame chains. |
| `max_bridged_chunks_per_file` | int | `1` | Max chunks kept per bridged file (first N by start line). |
| `coupling_threshold` | float | `0.1` | Minimum coupling **score** (0.0–1.0) for a coupled file to enter context. Distinct from `[git].coupling_threshold`, which is an integer co-change **count** applied during indexing. |
| `knowledge_budget_pct` | float | `15.0` | Percent of the line budget reserved for knowledge-graph expansion (requires the `knowledge` feature). |
| `knowledge_max_hops` | int | `2` | Max graph-traversal hops for knowledge expansion. |
| `budget_unit` | string | `"line"` | Unit the context budget is enforced in: `"line"` (count source lines) or `"token"` (estimate tokens per chunk, ~chars/4). Token mode makes injection size predictable against the model window; the budget value is then interpreted in tokens. |

### `[feedback]`

Tunes cross-agent feedback boosting. Files rated "useful" by other agents for similar queries get a bounded score boost during context assembly.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `boost_max` | float | `0.3` | Maximum feedback boost multiplier. Actual boost is `min(score * boost_weight, boost_max)`. |
| `boost_weight` | float | `0.2` | Weight multiplier applied to raw feedback scores. |

### `[server]`

Thin-client and HTTP-server options. All keys are unset by default.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `url` | string | _(unset)_ | Remote bobbin server URL. When set, this machine queries the remote server instead of a local index. |
| `bind_address` | string | _(unset → `"0.0.0.0"`)_ | Bind address for `bobbin serve --http`. Runtime fallback is `0.0.0.0` when unset. |
| `repo_path_prefix` | string | _(unset)_ | Filesystem prefix used to normalize absolute result paths back to repo-relative on the server. |

### `[dependencies]`

Controls dependency extraction and import resolution.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |

| `resolve_imports` | bool | `true` | Enable import-path resolution |

### `[beads]`

Indexes beads (the Dolt issue tracker) as searchable content.

| `port` | int | `3306` | Dolt server port |
| `user` | string | `"root"` | Dolt user |
| `databases` | string[] | `[]` | Database names to index (e.g. `["beads_aegis"]`) |
| `include_comments` | bool | `true` | Include bead comments in indexed content |
| `include_closed` | bool | `false` | Include closed beads |
| `max_age_days` | int | `90` | Skip beads older than this many days (`0` = no limit) |
| `exclude_labels` | string[] | `[]` | Exclude beads carrying any of these labels (case-insensitive) — keeps sensitive beads out of the index |

### `[archive]`

| `sources` | table[] | `[]` | Archive sources — each `[[archive.sources]]` has `name`, `path`, `schema` (required) and optional `name_field` |

### `[access]`

Role-based access filtering — restricts which repos a calling role can see.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `default_allow` | bool | `true` | When true, repos not named in any rule are visible to all roles; when false, repos must be explicitly granted |
| `roles` | table[] | `[]` | Role rules — each `[[access.roles]]` has `name` (required) and optional `allow`, `deny`, `deny_paths` globs. `deny` beats `allow`. |

### `[sources]`

Source-link generation — maps indexed files to clickable forge URLs.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|

| `repos` | table | `{}` | Per-repo URL overrides under `[sources.repos]` (highest priority) |
| `forge_overrides` | table | `{}` | Per-host forge-type overrides under `[sources.forge_overrides]` |

### `groups`

Named repo groups for scoped search (`--group` CLI flag / `?group=` HTTP param). None by default; groups compose with `[access]` filtering. Each entry is an `[[groups]]` table with `name` and `repos` (both required).

### `file_types`

Custom file-type classification rules. None by default; evaluated in order, first match wins, with unmatched files falling back to the built-in classifier.

Built-in category names are `source`, `test`, `documentation`, `config`; custom names are stored and displayed as-is.

### `quipu_endpoint`

Top-level key (not a table). Quipu knowledge-graph endpoint (e.g. `"http://quipu.example"`); unset by default. When set, search results are annotated with entity spotlight data. Must appear before the first `[section]` header in the TOML.
